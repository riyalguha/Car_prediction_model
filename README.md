# Car_prediction_model
A Deep Learning Model that predicts the price of second hand cars based on 8 features i.e the years,km,rating,condition,economy,top_speed,hp,torque.
## Model Details
### We used Adam Optimizer(SCG ALGO)
### 3 Dense layers were used of Dense(128){Hidden Layers}
### tf.data.Dataset API was used to train faster
### Analysis of the results were done
### 80% data for Trainning , 10% for validation and 10% for Testing the model.
### Sequential API was used to build the Model
### Adaptive Normalization was applied in this project
